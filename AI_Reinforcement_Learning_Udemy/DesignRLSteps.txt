# 1 - Prediction Problem:
	Given policy, find V(s)
	Code: Goal-> Find V(s)
		given: policy 
		V(s) = initial value
		for t in range(max_iterations):
			states, actions, rewards = play_game(policy)
			update V(s) given (states, actions, rewards) using the algorithm you learned
		print useful info (change in V(s) vs. time, final V(s), policy)

# 2 - Control Problem:
	Find the 'optimal policy' and the corresponding 'value' function
	Code: Goal-> Find the optimal policy (policy may not be explicitly represented)
		initialize value function and policy
		for t in range (max_iterations):
			states, actions, rewards = play_game(policy)
			update value function and policy according to (states, actions, rewards) using the algorithm you learned
		print useful info (change in V(s) vs. time, final V(s), final policy)
